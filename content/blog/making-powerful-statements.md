title: Making Powerful Statements
description: To speak powerfully, practice saying less.
---
I spend more time speaking or presenting in my role at Apptegy than in any past role I've had. My practice has come through thousands of interviews, 30+ onboarding classes of new hires, and other meetings and events. As a result, I have improved my presentation skills. 

Now, I am working to use my daily speaking opportunities to more intentionally improve in 5 key areas:

### 1. Pyramid Principle
The Pyramid Principle is a technique developed by Barbara Minto while at McKinsey. Since then it's become the defacto way of presenting an idea for every consulting firm. I am practicing it in a basic form: say the answer/conclusion first and then support it (not the other way around). 

By stating the answer first my audience does not need to wonder where I'm going with my thinking and, if they agree at the outset, I may not need to deliver all of my supporting reasoning, logic, or data.

### 2. Is it worth it?
Effective speaking often includes not speaking. Asking the question, "Is it worth it?" is simple, but not easy. It's been as helpful recently at work as it has at home. I hope that asking this question will be the tool that helps me hold back words even when it's difficult. 

### 3. Saying thank you
Similar to the point above, saying thank you is a tactic that is simple but not easy. After someone gives a compliment, shares feedback, or gives criticism, I will say "thank you." It forces me to be more accepting and less defensive.

### 4. Gaining confidence with silence
Out of the 5 tactics, 3 involve silence or brief responses. Although similar to 2 & 3, the difference here is focused on comfortability and confidence with silence after making a statement. 

Most important for me, is using silence as a tool to let the other person keep talking. I count on my fingers (hidden from view on a Zoom call) to practice this. Already I've noticed as a result of this that others share more information and ask questions they otherwise would not have. In larger groups, it makes it easier for other to join the conversation. 

### 5. Removing trailing words ("so")
For as long as I can remember, in casual conversations I use the words "so" and "right?" after a monologue or sentence. This may be the hardest area to work on because it's small, innocent, and, to others, not as noticeable. I'm confident that the other 4 areas of improvement will help me succeed in this area.

When practiced, I expect to be able to deliver what I'm calling powerful statements. Powerful because every word is aimed towards the same thing and has earned its place. Statement because it is just as short and as long as it needs to be.
