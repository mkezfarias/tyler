title: The Energy Flywheel
description: Stop trying to balance your time and energy... and just go faster.

The most draining, dull and lifeless days I have to start the same way: by trying to relax and take it easy. The result is I feel worse that I did when I started the day and don't really feel rested at all. 

The days when I know I can't relax and I just have to get work done are the days when energy comes easily and I can tackle whatever else pops up. It's really remarkable how much I've completed some days and equally remarkable how much I did nothing on others. 

I think most people would agree that when you are being productive it's easy to get more done and more easily. 

And yet, most of people would also argue for the importance of finding work/life balance â€” not having enough time to unwind or to catch up on this or that thing outside of work. The only way to find work/life balance in this scenario is to take from one and give to the other. 

There in lies the problem. 

Viewed that way all tasks, relaxation, work, relationships, etc are equal. It's only a matter of how much time you attribute to each. 

I prefer to feel alive, productive and full of energy. And yet, when I try to "refill my cup" I feel more drained that before. 

Now, I like to think of my days as a flywheel. The more energy I put in the more I get out. Pouring my full-self (energy, attention, and intention) into work does not make me empty for home life and relationships outside of work. In fact, it's just the opposite. The energy grows and I can be even more intentional outside of work.

On a podcast I heard Neil Pasricha, the writer, said something like, "At work if you love it, you're in the zone, you're having breakthroughs, you're energized and you feel awesome. Guess which version of you, you take home? The awesome version of you."

That's my approach to energy management now. Have breakthroughs and do your best work and use that same energy and version of you in your personal life.
